*ThoughtMachine.* Most of the changes we've
made for ourselves over the years
except for a few we no longer need
or just don't fit in style wise, but
including some that are hard to find
because either people forgot about
them or simply because they haven't
been released yet, a few we really love,
one we think is just ok, some we did
for free, some we did for money, some
for ourselves without permission and
some for friends as swaps but never on
time and always at our office in Old Street.
